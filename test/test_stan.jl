        Incredible: 

            Different results on windows vs mac vs ubuntu CI
            seems consistent/reproducible within platform, with 
                mac: 111 round trips - see  https://github.com/Julia-Tempering/Pigeons.jl/actions/runs/5627237742/job/15249456691?pr=88
                win: 42              -      https://github.com/Julia-Tempering/Pigeons.jl/actions/runs/5627237742/job/15249456981?pr=88

            Probably due to Stan's C++ toolchain/dependency version 
                differing across platforms..
