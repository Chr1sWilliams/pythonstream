$SIGNATURES 

Heuristic to automate the process 
of sorting `include()`'s.
 
Topological sorting of the source files under src 
(excluding `main`) is attempted, if successful, print the 
include string to copy and paste to the main file, otherwise, 
print the detected loops. 

Internally, this function will:

1. Construct a graph where the vertices are the .jl files 
    under src, excluding the provided `main` file (i.e. where the module is 
    defined and the includes will sit in).
2. Each file starting with a capital letter is assumed to 
    contain a struct with the same name as the file after 
    removal of the .jl suffix. Similarly, files starting 
    with `@` are assumed to contain a macro with the similarly 
    obtained name.
3. Each source file is inspected to see if the above struct and 
    macro strings are detected. This defines edges in the graph.
    (known limitation: this includes spurious edges when e.g. 
    the string occurs in a comment).
